#What's this? 👀
I made my own personal website online using GitHub. I created a fork from a academic website template on Github (citation below!). The site is still under construction 🛠️

A Github Pages template for academic websites. This was forked (then detached) by [Stuart Geiger](https://github.com/staeiou) from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/), which is © 2016 Michael Rose and released under the MIT License. See LICENSE.md.
